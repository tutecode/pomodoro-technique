# Pomodoro Technique


La idea es motivarte o aprender a traves de pantallas de windows

CHATGPT opinion:

Me: do you consider that this idea is a very good technique to be motivated while you are working showing images of motivational phrases?

ChatGPT: Yes, incorporating motivational phrases or images into your work routine can be a helpful technique to stay motivated and focused. Visual stimuli, such as motivational images or quotes, can inspire and energize you during work sessions. They can serve as reminders of your goals, boost your mood, and provide a positive mindset.

The Pomodoro technique, combined with motivational images or phrases, creates a structured work pattern with intermittent breaks. This approach helps maintain productivity and prevents burnout. The brief breaks can be used to reflect on the motivational content and reinforce your motivation and determination.

However, it's important to note that individual preferences and what works for one person may not work for another. It's always a good idea to experiment and find techniques that personally resonate with you and enhance your productivity and motivation. Some people might prefer music, affirmations, or other forms of motivational content. The key is to find what inspires you and helps you maintain focus and enthusiasm throughout your work sessions.
